			<h4>Get Rid of Distractions!</h4>
			<p>Facebook, Twitter, your cranky aunt who just happens to drop by to tell you all about her gout will slow your roll.</p>

			<p>Give yourself the power to say "No" to visitors and distractions in your life so you can really focus and get shit done.</p>

			<h4>Gain Context</h4>
			<p>It's easy to jump in head first into a programming language but if you have no idea what or why it is useful you will have a hard time wrapping your head around these new concepts.</p>

			<ul><h4>Here's what I suggest:</h4>

				<li><strong>Block out time everyday to watch a few YouTube videos on the language. </strong>It doesn't matter if you don't completely understand what they are saying but it's just to familiarize yourself with the words they use. </li>
				<li><strong>Read blogs.</strong> Same as above, you may not understand but we are great at picking up patterns. You may find yourself saying, "Hey, yah. I've seen this before."</li>
				<li><strong>Read Job Descriptions. </strong>These can be a great way to help plan out your learning. From one language you'll most likely move on to others. So reading job descriptions can help give you a roadmap for future learning and will help kill overwhelm if you are planning on creating a career out of programming.</li>
				<li><strong>Join local meetups. </strong>There are others just like you going through the learning process at times an online support system just isn't the same as a live human.</li>
